<div id=content><p>I made a thing, I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool: <a href=https://kashav.github.io/identicon>kashav.github.io/identicon</a>.</p>
<p>It let&rsquo;s you play around with pixels to choose a Github avatar pattern and then finds all user ids that hash to that pattern.</p>
<p>It started with <a href=https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/>this</a> blog post, but the author couldn&rsquo;t recall much, so it was mostly built on the backs of <a href=https://github.com/stewartlord/identicon.js>stewartlord/identicon.js</a> and <a href=https://github.com/dgraham/identicon>dgraham/identicon</a>. They&rsquo;re ports of the algorithm by former(?) Github employees. Only the second one gets the colours correct, so I only followed that one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of the algorithm and how the reversal works (with examples and everything) in the readme. It also talks about bits and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_nibbler>nibbles</a> and md5 and some other really cool things.</p>
<p>My favourite avatar, as you may have guessed, is the empty avatar: <a href=https://github.com/catsbyfella>github.com/catsbyfella</a>. I call it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkBgHk94mw">The Big Nothing</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, the <a href=https://github.com/kashav/identicon>code is on GitHub</a>, feel free to star it or leave a comment or do whatever it is you normally do with other open source projects.</p>
