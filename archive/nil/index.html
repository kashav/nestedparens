</header>
<main>
<div id=content><p>Everyone&rsquo;s always amazed that I have an empty inbox on <a href=https://mail.google.com title=seo>mail.google.com</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d make a post about how I achieve that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I do. Repeat this for every email in your inbox.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, this would be a flow chart. It&rsquo;s not a perfect world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yPZwezd-w8" title="I saw them perform this live. They knelt during the Audre Lorde outro. It was great.">though</a>, so here&rsquo;s a numbered list.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ask yourself if it&rsquo;s important. If it&rsquo;s not, DELETE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is important, print it (with a printer), and then file it in a filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Maybe fax it to a friend (you&rsquo;ll have to find one with a lot of filing cabinets) or a professional note keeper (they exist too, apparently). If it&rsquo;s about work or money or something important, you should make a note of where you&rsquo;re putting it, because you probably don&rsquo;t want to forget about it. Then DELETE.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of it.</p>
<p>Naturally the count ebbs and flows. It can&rsquo;t stay at zero all day! The goal is just to reach that eventually. Good luck, and Happy April 1st!</p>
